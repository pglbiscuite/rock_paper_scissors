# Rock Paper Scissors - Mini Game

This is my second, mini, simple game in python, while I am still learning how to code. 

I know there are probably plenty of better ways of doing this, but for now my spagetty code will have to work.

If you are reading this and have tried the game out, I appreciate it a lot.

As a final Note I want to Thank everyone in this amazing community for sharing their knowledge and helping!
